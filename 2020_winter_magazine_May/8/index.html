 FROM THE HEAD OF SCHOOL Dear TAS Community, The final week of the school year is upon us. This year has been one of celebration: the school’s 70th anniversary, awards for students across divisions and activities, and smaller “wins” for each student who has mastered a new concept that was previously unknown. It has also been one of historic loss: the loss of physical contact here on campus briefly and the loss of life around the world. In times of extremes, one’s character and values become more clear to an outside observer. It has become clear to me this year that the character of the Taipei American School community is one of resilience, grit, and gratitude. For this last week of school, our team has prepared an important special digital edition of The Window magazine. In these words and pictures, let’s reflect on (and celebrate) all that we have achieved together this spring, the ways in which our community has rallied around learning while protecting the safety of all in our home country. Never before has it become so clear that each individual has an impact on the larger world. So, too, does each activity and event portrayed in this mini-magazine represent a large effect on the safety of our community. Let me express on behalf of everyone here at school how grateful we are that our government was so wise, our community so supportive, our students so resilient, and every employee in the School so committed to being our best that we can say we did the very best we could do even under extraordinary circumstances. Even though opinions often differed, everyone pulled together, in one direction, to support student learning and student care. In a year that was unprecedented for every one of us, indeed unprecedented in the educational world, students’ best interests and needs guided every final decision. Having our seniors gathered together for the graduation ceremony was representative of what this faculty can do even in uniquely challenging times. I speak for all of us here at school in expressing gratitude for the role played by the Taiwan leaders; thank you for keeping our students safe. I thank every parent for recognizing what we could and could not do, and always supporting the decisions we made, whether they were your first choice or not. I thank our Board of Directors for the understanding and the steady, guiding hand it provided to us throughout this storm. I recognize and congratulate the resilience, determination, and fortitude of every Tiger in the School. I applaud the tireless, dedicated work of an administrative team I am honored to work with all day every day; there is none better. And I close by thanking our school heroes, the staff and teachers and counselors who never said no, never said “good enough,” and sustained the march to excellence for which TAS has become known doing work rarely asked of educators in a time unique to the world.  Thank you. I wish each student,faculty member, staff member, administrator, parent, and board member a happy last week of the school year and a reflective summer of rest and relaxation. It is well-deserved. Faithfully, Sharon D. Hennessy, Ed.D.
