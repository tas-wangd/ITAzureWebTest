 STUDENT TRIPS &amp; ACTIVITIES Middle and Upper School Speech and Debate “As is true for many extra- curricular activities around the world, COVID-19 caused a significant disruption to the speech &amp; debate community. However, through the dedication of students and coaches around the world - speech &amp; debate adapted and is thriving. Obviously, competing at American tournaments through an online platform means that ourTAS students are competing in the middle of the night—but we are so thankful that they are able to compete at all. Preparation for tournaments hasn’t changed significantly, although we do have to consider things like speaking to the camera vs. speaking to an audience and have had to think carefully about tech needs, internet bandwidth, etc. We’ve found solutions to these challenges by using additional technology that is available on campus and through moving our competition venue to hotels in Taipei (since students on campus at 3:00 am seems problematic!). Thankfully, the TAS community has been so helpful at every turn.We had a great experience competing at the Online TOC and are looking forward to the Online NSDA National Tournament in June.” - Chase Williams, Director of Speech and Debate Grades 6-12 Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Assessments “Our AP and IB teachers were nothing short of amazing.The IB asked teachers to assess far more work than in a typical year, and our teachers did so without complaint to ensure that our students will receive their IB scores in July. AP teachers adapted to the demands of an evolving curriculum, fully preparing our students to succeed on a new test format. Our students are rising to the challenge, taking more than 1025 AP exams despite having to do so during the middle of the night.” -Warren Emanuel,AP/IB Coordinator Lower School and Middle School Musicals “Performing the lower school musical, “The Rainbow Fish” musical, was a rewarding but challenging experience for students this year. The cast and crew faced numerous hardships such as wearing face masks that muffled their voices and facial expressions, extending the rehearsal schedule by over a month to finish the show, re-learning music, blocking and choreography due to a month-long break, dealing with numerous schedule changes and performance dates, and finally, performing a show without the feedback of a live audience. Nevertheless, the students faced these challenges with a positive attitude and persevered to put together a performance filled with energy and enthusiasm.  The entire production team worked collaboratively to make the show a success.” - Julie Kozak, Lower School Musical Director “Following on from our return to school, we were aware that the middle school musical could be cancelled at any point.The students involved were made aware of the situation, and were asked if they wanted to proceed— which was met by a unanimous ‘yes.’ My educational philosophy and that of middle school drama has always been about the process rather than the product, therefore I felt it was important for us to proceed and tackle each obstacle as they arose with the acceptance that we could be cancelled. An adult pit replaced our usual student pit band, and  we accepted early on that we would most likely be performing to video.  The wearing of masks initially posed a challenge with regards to articulation, projection and breath control but the students rose to the challenge.The students proved themselves to be resilient and flexible, and this was a testament to what can be achieved with a shared goal, and a lot of positivity and humor.” - Georgina Christou, Middle School Musical Director TAS Hosted Digital IASAS Cultural Convention “COVID-19 interfered with the IASAS Cultural Convention travel this year, prompting TAS to host the first-ever Virtual IASAS Debate and Forensics Convention. Using the Dean of Students’ office as Virtual Ground Zero,all six IASAS schools joined virtual live and pre-recorded speech and debate events, while 40+ judges across the region scrambled to adjudicate the different submissions and live debates. Zoom was the primary digital connector, with four simultaneous debates running in a round-robin format, with the two teams, the judge, and spectators tuning in from all six locations. Thanks to the hard work of the Debate and Forensics coaches and the commitment to IASAS values, the participants were assured of a fair and fun competition.” - Dr. Dan Long, Upper School Dean of Students
