 Kindergarten Digital FieldTrip Since Kindergarten students were unable to go on a field trip to the zoo, their teachers created a virtual field trip for them this spring. Rotating through classrooms, where each room was a different exhibit, students were able to watch animals on live webcams, making terrific observations and asking questions like, “Why didn’t the big octopus just share the rock with the little one?” Teachers/Zookeepers guided students through lessons on animal behavior and anatomy, and then students captured their observations in their notebooks before enjoying a picnic in theTiger Garden. Upper School FIRST Robotics Competition Livestream Awards for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) 2020 season were announced this spring in a live stream event, and TAS’s FRC Robotics team won the Chairman’s Award at the Taichung Regional. Considered to be the most prestigious award in FRC, the Chairman’s Award is more than a robotics award; it recognizes community outreach and positive impact on others. TAS team captain Emily H. (‘20) summarizes the team’s impact on the island’s robotics community: “We created the infrastructure for FIRST Robotics in Taiwan as the first FRC team in the country. We lead initiatives to start new FRC teams, train them from the ground up, and run competitions so rookie teams can gain valuable experience. With the construction of the Solomon Wong Tech Cube, we also began hosting our own training sessions and scrimmages,” which have resulted in 22 brand new robotics teams in Taiwan. In writing a congratulatory email to her team this morning, Emily humbly expressed sincere appreciation for everyone’s dedication and effort. “We won this award due to the contributions of all of you and all the generations that came before us.” Middle School Choir Preferring to showcase the works they’ve studied this spring in a live concert setting rather than in a closed auditorium (video recorded), the Middle School Choirs have researched alternative concert venues. To find that ‘sweet spot’ for their on-campus performance, they did some site explorations, singing in outdoor walkways, the bleachers near the track, the lobby of the Solomon Wong Tech Cube, and around the courtyard.They are also exploring indoor concert locations; the Grade 8 Choir sang in and above the main lobby last Friday, with a physically distanced formation across three floors! Demonstrating resilience, flexibility, and an eagerness to find solutions, our students and teachers have been incredibly positive and supportive, embracing the new normal with grace. TAS MUN Online Conference TAS MUN student leaders developed an online manual and a modified event so that the 11th annual TASMUN conference could take place this spring, although it took place online.This year’s theme,“Uniting Our Lennon Walls,” hopes to address the need for unity in times of uncertainty.
