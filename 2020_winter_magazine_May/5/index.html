 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND MEETINGS Lower School Teachers College LiteracyWebinars “The professional development that we attended was fantastic. Not only did it help us prepare to use a new phonics program, it also showed us how we can be more effective in delivering engaging lessons that help us connect with students and meet their individual needs during distance learning. Distance learning for professional development wasn’t quite as rewarding as traveling to Teachers College for professional learning. We missed out on the connections you make with other teachers from around the world as you sit in a room waiting for a session to begin or over lunch. However, the amazing staff developers at Teachers College Reading andWriting Project made the content engaging and used technology in innovative ways that let us try out new assessment tools and teaching practices with other attendees.” - Amanda Jacob and Stacey Johnsen, Lower School Literacy Coaches Faculty Meetings via Zoom “Although we miss having the opportunity to meet in person, our Zoom faculty meetings have been a great way to stay connected as a full faculty.  With the versatility available on Zoom, we continue to be able to highlight faculty presenters and we have made good use of the “chat” function to address questions in real time.Typically in the last week of school the upper school faculty gathers to say goodbye to any departing faculty.  This year, we’ll do so virtually with faculty sharing videos they’ve put together that honor those who are leaving TAS. We are excited for a time when we can again be in one room, however, we are so thankful that we have such great options for gathering as a group virtually.” - Jill Fagen, Upper School Associate Principal SummerTeacher Grants for Digital Teaching Excellence Distance learning, and distance teaching, is here to stay. Professional journals make clear that being a teacher of this generation requires having the skills and flexibility to deliver high-quality instruction in the “anywhere, anytime” format. After transitioning to two different sessions of distant learning during the 2019- 202 school year, the school is now working to more fully develop a new teaching standard  for all faculty, one that sets the expectation that all classroom teaching faculty must learn to be as effective, from a content coverage perspective, via distance teaching as they already are when teaching a student in-person. In order to help the school achieve that goal, all TAS teachers were recently invited by Dr. Sharon Hennessy to complete optional professional development over the summer of 2020.  Participating teachers will receive a grant from the school to pursue relevant professional development activities that will lead to more effective distant teaching. In addition, they will be expected to produce content with the goal of being prepared to successfully start school on time and run the first two weeks of classes, regardless of whether we are able to do so on campus or require it to be by distance learning.
