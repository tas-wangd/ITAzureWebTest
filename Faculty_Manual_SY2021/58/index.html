 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 51 July 1, 2020 Taipei American School will protect original works produced for the School by placing on the work the words “Copyright &#169; (year) by Taipei American School Foundation, Taipei, Taiwan.  All rights reserved.”  The Head of School will develop procedures for determining which works will be treated in this manner. 4.8 Language Policy A goal of Taipei American School is to encourage all students to use English effectively.    During classroom instruction, only English should be used by all students except in Mandarin or other world languages classes. Please see Appendix C for Language Policy. 4.9 Non-Classroom Service Duty Each Professional Staff member has a responsibility for the total school program and will be evaluated on the basis of his or her contributions to the total program.  Professional Staff members are expected, as part of their professional responsibility, to spend an average of an hour and a half (1- 1/2) per week, or between sixty and seventy hours per year, in co-curricular assignments. Depending on the project, these hours could be spent over the entire year or during a concentrated period.  Time spent during the normal school day and time for which compensatory leave or extra-duty pay is awarded cannot be considered in calculating total time. 4.10 Parent Concerns, Complaints, and Grievances Any general complaint, comment, or grievance, not directly related to his/her child, which any parent desires to make may be referred in writing to the Head of School, who may bring the matter to the attention of the Board. In cases of discipline, a grievance, or other matters relating to their children, parents will first discuss the matter with the child’s teacher.  If for some reason, the matter cannot be resolved with the teacher, the parent may discuss the matter with the Principal of their child’s division.  If the Principal cannot resolve the matter, the parent may refer the matter to the Head of School in writing. 4.11 Professional Publishing Publishing of materials prepared at school direction or during school compensated time by any Employee shall become the property of the School, unless there is a written agreement concerning royalties.
