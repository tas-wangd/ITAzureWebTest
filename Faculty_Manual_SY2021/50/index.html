 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 43 July 1, 2020 3.22 Professional Organizations Staff members may form or join organizations to represent their professional interests provided that their leadership or membership positively benefits Taipei American School.  Such organizations must operate in compliance with board policies and administrative regulations. 3.23 Reduction in Force In case reduction in force requires the separation of one or more Employees, the Head of School shall generally utilize the following criteria in recommending renewal of all Employee contracts: 1. Performance (evaluations at the School in the position). 2. Qualifications (academic preparations, teaching or work experience). 3. Longevity (years of employment at TAS in the position). 3.24 Smoking Taipei American School is a no smoking facility. 3.25 Solicitations and Gifts No personal gifts or gratuities may be accepted that might influence the proper judgment of an Employee of the School in the performance of his or her duty, or convey the appearance of such influence. The aim of this regulation is to protect Employees from possible conflict of interest, incurring any perceived obligation to the giver, and to ensure that services are offered to all without bias. Under no circumstances should a TAS Employee ever initiate discussion about the giving of a gift. It is understood that all Administrators and purchasing personnel shall not accept gifts from students, faculty, staff, outside vendors or others doing business with the School (except consumables such as fruit, flowers, etc.) under any circumstances. All other Employees are expected to adhere to the guidelines stated above. In cases where the return of a gift is called for and circumstances make this difficult, the Employee will inform and enlist the aid of his or her supervisor.
