 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 3 July 1, 2020 Taipei American School Beliefs and Mission School Beliefs and Mission The mission of the Taipei American School is as follows: Taipei American School is an innovative 21 st century learning community. Our mission is to inspire each student to be a confident, creative, caring and moral individual prepared to adapt and succeed anywhere in a rapidly changing world. We provide an American-based education with a global perspective that results in a love of learning, academic excellence, a balanced life, and service to others. Taipei American School is an academic institution whose purpose is to provide a program to meet the educational needs of expatriate students residing with their families in the greater Taipei area.  The curriculum will be primarily American, but will be adjusted within available resources to meet the needs of its other foreign nationals. We maintain that: • Instruction should be student-centered, active, and differentiated. • All students can learn given appropriate time and instruction. • Equity means each student receives the instruction and time required to reach the educational standards.  While all students reach the standards, differentiated learning rates are accommodated and a variety of common assessment formats will be used. As appropriate, students are assessed on what they have been taught and when they are ready. We believe that: - Every person has equal intrinsic worth. - Each person is responsible for the choices he or she makes. - Everyone benefits when individuals choose to contribute to the well-being of humankind and the environment. - Family life provides the foundation for the development of the individual. - Honesty, respect, responsibility, and kindness are fundamental to all we do. - Learning is a valuable, lifelong process. - Personal well-being requires that each person attain his or her own balance of the physical, social, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual aspects of life. - Reaching full potential requires people to do their best. - Each person can learn, and learns in different ways and at different paces. - Developing positive interpersonal relationships is directly related to the health of any community. - Education is a joint responsibility of students, parents, and the School. - Open, honest, respectful communication and empathy are essential to mutual understanding. To attain our mission, purpose, and beliefs, students shall continually be exposed to high standards of excellence through the use of thoughtfully selected instructional materials presented by a well-qualified and dedicated faculty.
