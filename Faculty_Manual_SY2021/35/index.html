 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 28 July 1, 2020 2.5  Leave Without Pay 2.5.1 Short-Term Leave Without Pay Short-Term Leave Without Pay is a benefit that allows the Employee to take leave to deal with emergencies or personal business not covered in other Accrued Leave benefits or when Accrued Leave has been exhausted.  With the approval of the Employee&#39;s supervisor and the Head of School, an Employee is allowed to take a maximum of five (5) days per school year for the purpose of attending to personal business or emergencies that cannot be taken care of before or after the work day. In cases where the Employee or an immediate family member is ill, Accrued Leave has been exhausted, and leave from the illness leave bank is not available, there is no limit to the number of days that may be approved within a valid contract period. This leave will not be allowed to shorten the end of the school year nor to create a later starting date at the beginning of the school year; nor may Leave Without Pay be taken to lengthen a scheduled school holiday. An Employee on Leave Without Pay will not receive base salary for the days that such leave is granted.  The livelihood supplement will continue until the end of the contract or the Employee and his or her Authorized Dependents leave Taiwan, whichever comes first. 2.5.2 Long-Term Leave of Absence Without Pay Leave of Absence Without Pay may be granted at the discretion of the Head of School within the contractual period for up to one year. With the prior approval of the Head of School, an Employee may resign from Taipei American School and be granted a one-year Leave of Absence Without Pay.   Within a one-year period of time, the Employee may reapply for a position.  If the Employee is rehired, the year away from Taipei American School will not be considered a break in employment for salary placement, but the Employee will not accrue any benefits during this absence.  The School does not guarantee reemployment. The granting of a Leave of Absence Without Pay neither enhances nor prejudices the Employee’s application for reemployment. The Head of School may extend a Leave of Absence Without Pay for up to one additional year.
