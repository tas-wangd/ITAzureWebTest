 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 74 July 1, 2020 Chapter 9: Student Expectations Student expectations are set out more fully in the student handbooks. 9.1 Dress Code Students are expected to be appropriately dressed. Students and parents must take responsibility to ensure that a standard of neat appearance is met, keeping in mind the importance of dressing appropriately for the welfare of the School’s learning climate and our responsibility to the wider Taipei community. A neat, well-groomed appearance is expected as outlined in the student handbooks. Appropriate footwear must be worn at all times. 9.2 Possession of Dangerous Items Students who at school or school-sponsored activities have any kind of weapon or dangerous item in their possession—on their person, in their locker, or otherwise—will be sent home and parents will be notified. If the student is allowed to continue to attend TAS, stringent conditions may be put in place in order to guarantee the safety and welfare of the community. 9.3 Smoking TAS is a smoke-free zone, and smoking on school property is prohibited. This includes the use of tobacco on school buses or on the sidewalks surrounding the school, across the street in front of the Japanese School or the alley adjacent to the school car parking lot. 9.4 Truancy Truancy occurs when a student is absent from class without permission.  Before a student is re– admitted to school after a truancy, a parental conference may be required by TAS authorities with the parents of the truant child and a School Administrator. 9.5 Use of Drugs TAS is a drug-free zone. Any student possessing, taking or using, buying or selling, giving or trafficking in any narcotics, stimulants, depressants, barbiturates, hallucinogenic drugs, or marijuana (whether on or off campus) is subject to expulsion from the school. All Upper School students will be subject to random drug testing unless a student’s parents have previously signed a waiver. The waiver form must be signed before the student’s first day of class at the beginning of each school year. The cost of all testing will be borne by the school.
