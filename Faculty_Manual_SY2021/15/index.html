 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 8 July 1, 2020 1.3 Expectations for All Employees All School Employees, as well as members of the Board, shall adhere to the policies established by the Board. Employment is based on qualifications regardless of race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or other legally-protected characteristic.  All supervisors are expected to instruct, counsel, advise and direct their subordinates.  When circumstances require, they will make every effort to recommend timely, fair and equitable correction, solution of problems, discipline or termination of personnel under their supervision when warranted by substandard work performance or conduct. Each Employee is expected to respect the personal rights and property of other Employees and to maintain the high standards of personal behavior that are consistent with being a good citizen and with the TAS values.  Article 6.2 of the employment contract emphasizes the special responsibility of each Employee to develop and maintain satisfactory interpersonal and professional relationships with colleagues, supervisors, students and others in the School community. The relationship of the Professional Staff, Administrators, and Classified Staff should be that of partners working together to provide the best possible learning environment for the students of the School within clearly defined lines of organizational structure and reporting requirements.  Dealings between Employees should be based on integrity and mutual respect.  Personal prejudices should in no way interfere with the proper operation of the School. In general, student behavior is the responsibility of the Professional Staff and Administrators, and all Professional Staff members have a responsibility to the whole School and for all students, regardless of their grade level. Professional Staff members and Administrators cannot ignore misbehavior by any student and when a Professional Staff member observes misbehavior, he or she should take immediate appropriate action. Classified Staff Employees shall not assume authority to discipline students.  Their primary function shall be to monitor a designated situation and to report irregularities to the appropriate Administrator; however, should any Employee witness a violation of regulations, such as destruction of property, physical abuse of other students, etc., the Employee has a duty to take the steps necessary to prevent the destruction of property or the physical abuse of other students and to immediately report such incidents to the appropriate School Administrator. In all cases, the guiding principle should be placing student safety first. All open faculty and staff positions are to be advertised in the system to our present staff. All new faculty and staff positions created at the School will be announced to all faculty and staff members as soon as practicable upon their authorization. In the case of open positions already authorized, the Administration will make internal transfers where appropriate or necessary to preserve employment
