 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 60 July 1, 2020 Though each case is unique, performance problems of that degree of severity usually come to the attention of administrators quickly through a variety of channels, some of which are outlined above at the beginning of this section.  Administrators may observe problematic teaching personally when they visit classrooms and watch lessons as they do with all new hires.  Alternatively, parents and students may have negative experiences and report them to administrators.  Perhaps there may be reported or observed difficulties around conduct with colleagues or students.  Any or all of the above moments should naturally spur administrators to offer extra attention and support to aid that teacher in succeeding in the classroom if they are able. Regular evaluations, a standard practice in all schools, represent one mechanism that does ensur the appropriate level of professionalism and professional growth for all teachers, and by implication, the best possible education for all students.  Our school’s definition of professionalism is to continually strive toward meeting these teaching standards, to have strong and current content knowledge, to take initiative, to take risks, and to take responsibility for continuously improving instructional practices to add value for our students, colleagues, and our school as a whole.  It is well understood that no teacher is master of all aspects of teaching; the goal is to always be striving for professional growth and mastery.  Thus, to reiterate, these standards should not serve as a checklist for ‘grading’ teachers.  They do, however, provide a framework for conferencing and goal setting. Exactly how these evaluations are conducted must necessarily vary by division as well as length of a teacher’s time at Taipei American School. For teachers new to TAS there are necessarily specific considerations shaping the evaluation timeline and process.  New teachers face tremendous personal and professional adjustment as they get used to the ways of our school and of Taiwan.  The initial evaluation process is intended to support that adjustment by clearly outlining measures of success and methods for achieving that success.  Thus, the first observation, typically conducted by both a department chair and a principal or vice principal, takes place within the first few weeks of arrival at Taipei American School.  All newly hired teachers begin on a probationary status for the first ninety days, and these observations ensure that the teacher is indeed an appropriate fit for our school.  In addition, teachers are evaluated in terms of their engagement with parents, cooperation and collaboration with colleagues, participation in schoolwide initiatives and projects, and of course the quality and frequency of their interactions with students outside classroom environs.  For teachers of grades three through twelve, students complete anonymous surveys in early spring each year, and their perspective on teacher performance are also taken into account.  Taken together, all of these elements provide clear direction for the teacher during their adjustment period, so that they might quickly and appropriately adapt and provide the highest quality experience for our students.  If significant teaching performance concerns are observed, the first step is to offer specific mentoring and developmental support to enable that teacher to meet those objectives.  Very rarely, such concerns rise to the level that successful meeting of our standards is deemed unlikely or impossible, and in such cases contracts are typically not renewed. For teachers not new to TAS, teacher evaluations continue at a different pace, and for all teachers the assessment of teaching standards will vary by division.
