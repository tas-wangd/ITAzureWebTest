 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 1 July 1, 2020 Introduction Welcome to Taipei American School! If you are a new employee, we are very glad that you have decided to join us. If you are a returning employee, it is a great pleasure to welcome you back to what promises to be another fine year in the growth and development of the School and our students. So, who are we?  Taipei American School (TAS or the School) is an American school serving a multi- ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-lingual international population.  We are an independent – private school with an American style curriculum that has long followed the principles of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS). Secondly, we are a college prep school but we are not only a college prep school. We are an American school, and that has to do with our belief in the profound potential of all children and the unlimited possibilities for each child.  TAS vision 2020 realized a mountaintop that TAS calls its own, one where every student has advocacy and support, programs and people and a place that assure that options and opportunities are unlimited.  At the core of an American educational program is the value that comes first in our TAS beliefs: every person has intrinsic worth.  All children have potential to learn, and will learn differently one from the other.  TAS as an American school believes in harnessing the profound, the pragmatic, and the possible for each and every student.  It means providing a global perspective and internationalism as a critical part of our curriculum. This means paying careful attention to the development of each student’s intellect and character, attending to the habits of the mind and the habits of the heart.  At TAS we work together to assure that our students are passionate to serve and prepared to lead. As you familiarize yourself with this handbook, please understand that it is intended to be a guide to our school’s employment, benefits, administrativ policies, practices, and philosophies. It is not meant to detail each and every standard or practice of the School, or to bind TAS contractually, but rather to serve as a reference for the main aspects of daily life at the School and a larger vision of the School’s ideals and expectations. TAS reserves the right to modify, add to, depart from or delete policies from time to time without notice. If you have any questions about the information contained in the handbook, please do not hesitate to speak with me at any time. With warmest regards, Dr. Shar n Hennessy, Head of School Taipei American School
