 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 15 July 1, 2020 Chapter 2: Employment Terms and Conditions for Professional Staff INTRODUCTION This manual explains the compensation plan for the Professional Staff employed by Taipei American School Foundation.  This is the manual referenced in the School&#39;s employment contract, and all terms defined in the contract have the same meaning in this manual. Any questions or need for further information should be directed to the School&#39;s Human Resources Director. 2.1 Salary 2.1.1  Base Salary STRUCTURE OF SALARY SCHEDULE The School&#39;s Professional Staff base salary schedule forms a grid of steps and levels.  The steps correspond to years of teaching experience and/or experience in the position for which the Employee has been contracted.  The levels correspond to educational preparation. (See Appendix A) PLACEMENT ON THE SCHEDULE The School&#39;s Head of School shall initially place Professional Staff on the professional salary schedule according to degree, qualifications, and teaching experience.  Up to five (5) years of full- time teaching experience in a recognized elementary or secondary school may be used for initial step placement.  No credit will be given for part-time work or for teaching prior to earning an undergraduate degree. The Head of School may place a new hire on a different level or step if experience or past accomplishments so warrant.  For non-teaching positions, relevant experience may be considered for initial step placement. All required evidence to support placement on the salary schedule (transcripts, verification of experience, certification, etc.) must be submitted to the Human Resources Office by the 30th of October of the contract year; otherwise, salary payments may be withheld and shall not warrant retroactive pay.  No other salary adjustments will be made after October 30. ADVANCEMENT ON SCHEDULE Once placed on the schedule, the Employee will advance one step per year automatically.  The Employee may advance by level by obtaining the necessary degree or credits.  Documentation of the required degree or semester credits must be submitted to the Human Resources Director on or before October 30 of the school year.  No adjustments will be made after October 30 of the school year.
