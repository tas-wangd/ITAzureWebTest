 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 39 July 1, 2020 3.15 Involuntary Termination All supervisors at Taipei American School are expected to instruct, counsel, advise and direct their subordinates.  Should an Employee exhibit unsatisfactory work performance and/or conduct, the supervisor must make every effort to be fair, just, and to consider all relevant facts, including said Employee&#39;s explanation of the situation. All Employees shall receive notification that the Employee’s performance and/or conduct is not satisfactory in sufficient detail and with sufficient time to allow for improvement where, in the reasonable judgment of the School, improvement is possible. (a) For Cause. At the discretion of the Head of School, the contract of any Employee may be terminated at any time for reasons of misconduct, deceit, poor judgement, immorality, incapacity, unsatisfactory attendance, insubordination, inefficiency, incompetence, harassment, inadequate performance, commission of a crime, failure to develop and maintain satisfactory interpersonal and professional relationships with colleagues, supervisors, students or others in the School community, or otherwise in accordance with the policies of the Board in effect at the time of termination (such reasons, individually and collectively, “Cause”).

Termination may also result during the probationary period, with or without cause (as defined in the Professional Staff Contract Article 6.2), or if said employment was secured through concealment of facts, which would have precluded his or her initial employment had such facts been known at the outset of employment.  Termination during or at the conclusion of the probationary period may also occur in accordance with the teacher supervision and evaluation process if significant teaching performance concerns are observed. At the discretion of the Head of School, the Employee may be placed on suspension (with or without pay) where the Head of School determines that circumstances warrant, for reasons of
