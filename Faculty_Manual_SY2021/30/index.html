 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 23 July 1, 2020 2.4 Leave With Pay 2.4.1 Accrued Leave Definition Full-time Employees shall earn Accrued Leave at the rate of one (1) day per month or partial month of contracted service. Part-time Employees earn Accrued Leave prorated according to their FTE. The Employee may accumulate unused Accrued Leave without limit. Accrued Leave may not be transferred between Employees. Employees may voluntarily join the illness leave bank, which requires a contribution of three (3) days of cashable Accrued Leave per year to the Employee illness leave bank . All leave must be reported to the Human Resources Director. In instances where the approval of the Employee&#39;s supervisor is required , the approval must come from the Administrator who has the responsibility to supervise the Employee. The Employee may use this leave in advance of accrual to the limit of that which will be earned during the contractual period. Use of Accrued Leave Illness. The Employee may use Accrued Leave for personal illness, quarantine at home, complications during pregnancy, or serious illness in the immediate family or household. Verification of illness by a medical doctor may be requested by the Head of School. Illness Leave Bank. The illness leave bank is established to assist Employees who have a short- term illness that exhausts all their accumulated illness leave prior to becoming eligible for long- term disability. Once the Employee becomes eligible for long-term disability, he or she will no longer be eligible to request days from the illness leave bank. In the event that an Employee has exhausted his or her Accrued Leave, he or she may submit a request to the Human Resources Director to withdraw days from the illness leave bank, provided he or she has joined the bank prior to the illness. Such a request must be accompanied by verification by a medical doctor and must be approved by the Head of School. Days drawn from the illness leave bank may only be used for personal illness, quarantine, complications during pregnancy, or serious illness in the immediate family or household.
