 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 34 July 1, 2020 2.10  Administrative Regulations: Procedures &amp; Calculations 2.10.1  Leave Request Procedure 1. Employees who require being absent from the School for reasons that are not normally considered a part of their daily job performance routine should request authorization for leave from the Administrator in charge of their division or section. 2. Employees with advance knowledge of a need to request leave should initiate the request by submitting a Taipei American School online Leave Request to the Administrator in charge of the division or section in which they are assigned. 3. The Administrator will approve or disapprove each request for leave and notify the requestor of the decision.  Approved leave requests will be forwarded to the Human Resources Office for leave record and data process. 4. An Employee who does not have an opportunity to submit a request for leave in advance of her or his absence should call the divisional anchor or department secretary/assistant and copy to Human Resources Office to report the reason for the need to be absent, time to be absent, and type of leave requested.  The divisional anchor or department secretary/assistant will submit the online Leave Request on behalf of the absentee.  The Administrator will approve or disapprove the request for leave, and notify the absentee and requestor of his or her decision.  The division or section is responsible for submitting the request for leave to the Human Resources Office. 2.10.2  Home of Record The purpose of establishing a Home of Record is to set a maximum amount that the School will expend for Employees and Authorized Dependents for Travel upon employment and termination, incoming shipment, and outgoing shipment.  The Employee may travel to and from a different location or may ship to or from a different location; however, the School will only expend an amount up to the authorized cost and weight to or from the Home of Record. For shipping, the School will contract with the shipper and make payments directly to the shipper.  If the Employee wishes to ship more than his or her allocation, the Employee is responsible for all additional payments.  The School will not be involved in any negotiations for shipping amounts over the allocation.  On a case-by-case basis, the School may approve a split shipment, as long as the total authorized cost and weight to not exceed the allotment. In regard to travel, the School will either provide a ticket or reimburse the Employee.
