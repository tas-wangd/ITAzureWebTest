 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 16 July 1, 2020 SALARY SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENTS The Board may approve salary schedule adjustments from time to time in its discretion. PAYMENT Professional Staff base salary will be paid in equal monthly payments normally on the last business day of each month unless otherwise noted on the payroll schedule.  The School has established an option for Professional Staff to opt for ten (10) equal monthly payments from August through May or twelve (12) equal monthly payments from July through June of each year. All payments are made in New Taiwan Dollars through direct deposit in the Employee&#39;s payroll account at the Lan Ya branch of the Mega International Commercial Bank. Once a payment option is selected, it cannot be changed during that school year. NEGOTIATED COMPENSATION AND BONUSES The Head of School may offer Employee compensation beyond what is described in the Employment Terms and Conditions for Professional Staff. Bonuses may be awarded subject to the approval of the Board chair and M&amp;R Committee chair. 2.1.2 Salary Advances The School&#39;s Head of School is authorized at his or her discretion to advance up to one month&#39;s base salary to an Employee upon the Employee&#39;s written request to alleviate a bona fide financial exigency.  A bona fide financial exigency is defined as a temporary condition, of an extreme nature, which would normally not be anticipated by a prudent person.  The Head of School is required to report any such salary advance to the Board at the next regular meeting of the Board.  Salary advances must be repaid on a monthly repayment schedule established by the Head of School (not to exceed six (6) months) and withheld from the Employee&#39;s monthly base salary payments.
