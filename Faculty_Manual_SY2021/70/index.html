Professional Development Days There are ten professional development days in the TAS school calendar. Seven of these days are at the beginning of the school year and are intended to prepare new and returning teachers for the coming year.  The other three days are spread out throughout the year to provide time for faculty training or team/department work.  The uses of these days are organized through the divisional administration with the help of the central administration and PD secretary. Conferences Every year there are action items on the strategic plan or within the program review cycle that call for professional development.  Individuals, teams or departments might be asked to take part in targeted professional development to enhance their capacity to implement or further initiatives. Personal Professional Development Faculty members may request to attend a conference, workshop or other professional development activity through the divisional Principal.  The request is initiated by completing the Divisional PD Request Form and submitting it to the appropriate divisional Principal for approval.

Taipei American School provides all interested teachers with the registration fee for the conference.  In addition, teachers may request to present a workshop.  If the workshop is chosen by the conference organizers, TAS will pay registration, flight and hotel.  Information about how to request to present a workshop will be sent through the professional development coordinator.
