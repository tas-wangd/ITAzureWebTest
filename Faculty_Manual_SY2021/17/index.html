 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 10 July 1, 2020 It is the policy of the Taipei American School to provide and maintain a workplace that is free of sexual and other forms of harassment.  This policy applies to all Employees of TAS, regardless of their position. Prohibited sexual harassment includes sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an Employee’s or student’s performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating or sexually offensive working environment.  In addition, no manager, supervisor, teacher or other staff member, male or female, may sexually harass any Employee or student by making submission to or rejection of sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment or education or a basis for employment or educational decisions.  An Employee who engages in sexual harassment shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. TAS also recognizes that harassment on the basis of race, religion, age, sex, color, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability or other legally-protected status is inappropriate in the workplace.  Conduct prohibited includes, but is not limited to, racial or ethnic slurs and epithets.  An Employee who believes that he or she has been subject to any such harassment is encouraged to report the matter promptly, using the complaint procedure outlined below.  Any Employee who violates this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. It is also a violation of TAS policy to retaliate against an Employee for making or filing a complaint of harassment or for cooperating in an investigation of a complaint of harassment.  Any such retaliation will also result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. If an Employee believes that she or he has been subjected to sexual or other harassment prohibited by this policy, whether by a supervisor, a co-worker or any other person with whom the Employee comes into contact in connection with his/her work for TAS, the Employee should report the incident immediately to the Human Resources Department.  An Employee may choose instead to contact the head of his or her school unit or another TAS manager or supervisor with whom the Employee feels comfortable. Any claim may be made orally or in writing. The following is an outline of the procedure that is generally pursued once a complaint has been brought to the attention of TAS: • A prompt and impartial investigation of the complaint is conducted by the Human Resources Director or another specifically designated manager or supervisor.  That investigation may include (but will not necessarily be limited to) interviews with the Employee who made the complaint, with the person or persons against whom the complaint was made, and with other employees who may have witnessed the reported incident or incidents.
