 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 53 July 1, 2020 4.15 Substitute for Support Staff Within budgetary limitations and at the discretion of the Head of School, qualified, approved personnel shall be employed as substitutes for an absent support staff, as needed. The request of hiring a substitute for an absent support staff should meet the criteria and be approved by the appropriate Principal/director. Criteria of hiring substitute for support staff: 1. Internal coverage is not available 2. Cross-training another staff to cover the absence is not possible 3. The absence will have a direct impact on student learning and student safety (such as the absence of a bus monitor, security guard, attendance clerk, cafeteria monitor, playground monitor, or student escort). 4. Special circumstances, as requested by a Principal/director and approved by the director of human resources. The director of Human Resources shall be responsible for maintaining a log of approved substitute personnel, listing areas of competence, from which each Principal/director may apply to obtain substitute employee to fill vacancies. A daily substitute rate will be approved annually as part of the base salary scale. Substitute employees are not eligible for any other benefits under the policies of the School. It is permissible for one staff member to substitute for another staff member if such arrangement is approved by the appropriate Principal/director. The substitute staff may not receive double pay for any work during the hours of his/her regular school day. 4.16 Tutoring Tutoring services may be provided to those students who are absent in excess of twenty (20) consecutive school days due to illness or incapacitation, not to exceed five (5) hours per week, providing such service is available.  A teacher may not accept special fees from parents and gratuities for tutoring or private lessons for a regularly assigned student unless that student is to be absent from school for an extended period of time and then only with the approval of the Head of School.  All other special arrangements for tutoring and/or private lessons between teachers employed at TAS and students enrolled in TAS must receive prior approval from the Head of School. 4.17 Tut ring on Campus There can be no private tutoring of students by non-school personnel on campus unless it is recommended as a special needs case by the student resource team (SRT) of the individual division. We realize that many parents arrange for private tutors for their children and this is outside the purview of the School; however, the actual tutoring must also be done off campus and completely exclusive of the School’s materials, facilities, and supplies.
