 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 61 July 1, 2020 In the Lower School, after successfully completing the first year, teachers are observed and evaluated by the principal and associate principals every third year.  Typically, the teacher supervisor will conduct formal classroom observations—with greater frequency of course if problems or concerns arise during the first observation. The time and date of one of these observations should be mutually decided upon.  Prior to the planned observation, the teacher completes a Visit Planner Document and submits to their evaluator.  After each observation, the supervisor then completes a standardized lesson observation form and sends it to the teacher.  The teacher then completes the ‘teacher response’ portion of the form and sends it back to supervisor.  After observations are completed in this way, the teacher submits a final self-reflection.   Lastly, the teacher and supervisor will meet to discuss and reflect on observations and overall performance, which will also take into account parent interactions, collegial collaboration, participation in school projects and initiatives, and interactions with students outside of the classroom (e.g. in student clubs, teams, and other activities during and after the school day).  For teachers of grade three through five, student surveys are also considered.  The principal and/or associate principal will write a final summary for the teacher to sign, which is then kept on file with human resources. In the Middle School, the process of evaluation is carried out by both the principal and associate principal.  Typically, the department chair will observe and mentor teachers through new initiatives in curriculum and pedagogy, but they are not central in the evaluation process.  Instead, the principal or associate principal will conduct observations—again with greater frequency if any problems or concerns arise following the first observation.  After each observation, the teacher meets with the observer to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the observed lesson, new strategies and techniques for improvement, and finally goals for short term and long-term professional growth.  As with all observations, the discussion is then summarized in a final document authored by the observer, coupled with student survey data and observations of teacher engagement with colleagues and the larger community where appropriate or relevant.  This evaluation is then signed by the teacher and kept on file with human resources for reference.  Teachers who have succeeded in their first year are subsequently formally evaluated on a three-year cycle. In the Upper School, department heads assume primary responsibility of observation and assessment.  As each department operates with range and flexibility best fitted to the leadership style and preferences of each department chair, assessments vary by department.  Each department head observes each teacher within their department, providing feedback and documentation of observations to the teacher and to the admi istration.  The mode of that assessment may vary.  For example, in the Upper School English department, the department chair typically observes every teacher, meets with that teacher to discuss the class observed, and then writes a narrative report detailing the teaching practices and goals for future growth and development.  In contrast, in the sciences, the chair may require that a teacher submit a video of one full class period.  The chair and teacher then meet and review the video together, discussing strengths and room for improvement.  Finally, the chair produces a narrative summary of that meeting, while also incorporating commentary regarding the teacher’s performance writ large, again in terms of their work with other teachers, interactions with parents, student survey data, and the teacher’s enthusiastic engagement with the student community outside the classroom.  These reviews are conducted annually for every teacher in every department, and the final documentation is signed by both chair and teacher and kept on file with Human Resources.
