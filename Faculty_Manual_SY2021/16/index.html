 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 9 July 1, 2020 for existing Employees without announcing the opening, or when the Head of School determines that an internal candidate meets all criteria and an extended search is unnecessary. All contracts will be written for clarity and to assure Employee compliance with the expectations of the School and with the School’s values. No Employee of the School or members of any Employee’s immediate family will accept gifts from any person, group, or entity doing or designed to do business with the School, and all business– related gratuities are specifically prohibited except items of nominal value that are widely distributed for the purpose of advertising. 1.4 Harassment The Taipei American School expects that adults in its employ will recognize that students’ safety, welfare, and health are our highest priority. It is the responsibility of adults charged with any aspect of the care and teaching of students to ensure that interactions among all members of the community are appropriate.  Adults associated with the School must ensure that they model attitudes and behaviors that reflect their awareness of this obligation, and create an environment in which the best interests of students are the highest priority. TAS condemns and expressly forbids any sexual contact or inappropriate relationships between adults and students and harassment of any kind.   At the beginning of each new school year at the opening address to Faculty, the Head of School will remind all teaching faculty that it is NEVER acceptable to put hands on a student in anger or with romantic intentions.  This does not mean that we may never provide an appropriate pat on the back or accept an offered hug from a student.  It does mean that touching a student in a way that results in the adult fulfilling his or her needs rather than to encourage a student is forbidden.  Disciplinary action up to and including termination will result.  It is expected that all Principals will make these expectations clear to all staff working with students as soon in the new year as possible, with clarity and firmness. TAS also forbids any personally offensive or threatening conduct or behavior directed against an individual or group for any reason, including but not limited to on the basis of a person’s ethnic origin, religion, gender or a person’s sexual orientation. All Employees of TAS are expected to demonstrate appropriate social media use and communication with students as stated in the Acceptable Use Policy for technology resources. All Employees are expected promptly to report to the Administration any acts of hazing, harassment or bullying of students, or any inappropriate relationships between other Employees and students.
