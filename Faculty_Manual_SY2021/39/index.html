 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 32 July 1, 2020 2.9 Force Majeure Closing 2.9.1 Definition If the School is temporarily or permanently closed by order of the ROC government or the Board of Directors as a result of a Force Majeure situation, Employees shall have the work obligations and be entitled to the benefits as stated below. Force Majeure for the purposes of this policy is defined as an event or effect that cannot reasonably be anticipated or controlled by the School, which affects the ability of the School to maintain the campus open to students in a safe and appropriate manner. Decisions by embassies and other organizations in the community to reduce personnel during a security emergency, while considered by the Board, will not necessarily cause the Board to determine Force Majeure. 2.9.2    Work Obligations As long as the School continues to pay the Employee’s salary, regardless of the Employee’s location, the Employee will be obligated to remain in contact with his or her supervisor and will perform work related to maintaining the instructional program through the online classroom and other means.  If conditions are appropriate, Employees may be required to perform their job responsibilities on campus.  Failure to perform work obligations during a Force Majeure situation will be considered a breach of contract and grounds for termination. 2.9.3    Off-Island Hired and Locally Hired Employees Force Majeure Benefits I. Off-Island Hired and Locally hired Employees shall be entitled to salary which shall be the lesser of (i) three (3) month&#39;s salary or (ii) normal monthly salary from date of official closure of school until the earlier of (a) re-opening of school or (b) the end of the Employee’s current contract. II. In the eve t of a permanent closure, or in the event an Employee’s contract expires during the Force Majeure emergency, the School will pay the Employee the amount of his or her accrued cash benefits that he or she would normally receive at the end of the contract period. III. In the case of a temporary Force Majeure closing, if an Employee refuses to return to the School after the emergency prompting the closure is no longer in effect, the Employee&#39;s refusal to return will be considered a breach of contract and the School&#39;s responsibilities as outlined in this policy will cease, unless the expiry date of the Employee&#39;s contract has been exceeded.
