 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 54 July 1, 2020 Chapter 5: Faculty Supervision and Evaluation 5.1 Taipei American School Teaching Standards These standards for teachers represent specific professional behaviors that, based on research and current practice, influence student achievement.  They are also customized for our school, based on our collective knowledge of the uniqueness of the Taipei American School community. Purpose: Clear and comprehensive teaching standards are a mainstay of world-class educational institutions (Stronge and Xu, 2017).  They allow teachers and administrators alike to identify and cultivate excellence in the classroom (Hattie and Clinton, 2010).  As a world-renowned educational institution striving always for excellence, Taipei American School obviously must maintain a clear and current set of teaching standards. However, it is not always automatically clear in what ways standards function within a school.  Perhaps the purpose is best clarified by John Hattie and Janet Clinton in their book, The Assessment of Teachers .  They explain that the majority of trained teachers are acceptably proficient in the classroom.  However, ‘acceptably proficient’ is hardly the gold standard of classroom practice.  Thus, for teachers demonstrating clear proficiency, standards are used to cultivate and direct professional growth across one’s career.  On the other hand, if a teacher fails to demonstrate proficiency, one hardly needs an elaboration of standards to see it, and the standards themselves are not the ideal mechanism for addressing difficulties at that more fundamental level. When we think about how documents like this one are best used, it is helpful to consider some parallels to the application of standards in the classroom.  When we develop a rubric for our students, for example, we do not do so in order to raise an unreachable bar and then ‘catch’ our students who fail.  Rather, rubrics and standards are shared with students for the purpose of encouraging self- awareness, to define the goals and objectives in their coursework, and to set comprehensive goals toward which each student can strive.  Rubrics also contain an array of knowledge and skills to be demonstrated in any particular classroom assignment, facilitating transparency between student and teacher.  Arguably, it would be impossible for any student to consistently do well without a clear definition of what it means to do well. Similarly, standards for teachers are here to serve our teaching work.  Teaching is an incredibly complex task, and being a teacher carries with it so many facets of performance that it can be difficult to maintain a consistent awareness of them all.  Furthermore, none of us is perfect in all aspects of our teaching.  Thus, having a comprehensive set of standards and goals for success allows us to reflect upon the wide diversity of strengths we already possess as well as the areas in which we might focus our efforts to improve.  Standards encourage us not to simply rest on our extant strengths but instead to continue striving to balance out our skills as best we are able, that we might become excellent teachers in a broad and well-rounded sense, maximizing what comes naturally and improving those skills that
