 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 50 July 1, 2020 students can expect to spend on home learning.  The following is a guideline for average number of minutes per class meeting during the course of a week. Light 0-30 minutes Moderate 30-60 minutes Heavy 60-90 minutes No home learning is assigned during winter holiday and Chinese New Year. 4.7 Intellectual Property Taipei American School will not purchase, or accept as a gift, a product that infringes upon a copyright, trademark, or a patent registered in the Republic of China or any other countries. The reproduction and/or use of software of published works or printed matter in violation of copyright laws, or beyond what is historically and legally considered as &quot;fair use,&quot; is strictly forbidden.  The &quot;fair use&quot; principle means the extent that copyrighted material may be copied without permission of the copyright owner and encompasses four conditions or tests: 1. Use to be made of copies. 2. Nature of copyrighted work. 3. Amount and substantiality of portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole. 4. Effect of use on the potential market for, or value of the copyrighted work. Following are examples of what does, or does not, constitute ‘fair use’: 1. Fair use applies only to reproduction for such purposes as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. 2. That copying is for nonprofit use has no bearing on the question of fair use. 3. Copying portions of a news article for use in the classroom may be fair use, but copying pages for classroom use from a workbook intended by the publisher to be used by an individual student will not be fair use. 4. Photocopying or duplicating by an individual for his or her personal use, as long as it is in a single copy of an article, short poem, or small portion of the work as a whole, is generally considered fair use. 5. Fair us allows teachers, acting on their own, to copy small portions of a work for the classroom, but does not allow the institution to do so. 6. Systematic duplication, whether making multiple copies at one time or single copies that in the aggregate add up to multiples, is not considered fair use. 7. If resulting economic loss to the copyright owner can be shown, even making a single copy of certain materials may be a violation.
