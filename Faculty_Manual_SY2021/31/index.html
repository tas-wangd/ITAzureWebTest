 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 24 July 1, 2020 • In order to become and remain eligible in the illness leave bank, Employees must donate three (3) days of Accrued Leave each year. • For faculty who did not join the illness leave bank in their first year of employment, the number of days required to join the illness leave bank will be based on the actual required donations for the previous three (3) years. • Five (5) days a year will be paid back to the bank automatically before leave days are accrued for the Employee who borrowed the leave from the bank.
