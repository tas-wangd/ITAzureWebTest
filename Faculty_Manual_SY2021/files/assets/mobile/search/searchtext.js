With the approval of the Employee's supervisor and the Head of School, an Employee is allowed to take a maximum of five (5) days per school year for the purpose of attending to personal business or emergencies that cannot be taken care of before or after the work day. In cases where the Employee or an immediate family member is ill, Accrued Leave has been exhausted, and leave from the illness leave bank is not available, there is no limit to the number of days that may be approved within a valid contract period. This leave will not be allowed to shorten the end of the school year nor to create a later starting date at the beginning of the school year; nor may Leave Without Pay be taken to lengthen a scheduled school holiday. An Employee on Leave Without Pay will not receive base salary for the days that such leave is granted.  The livelihood supplement will continue until the end of the contract or the Employee and his or her Authorized Dependents leave Taiwan, whichever comes first. 2.5.2 Long-Term Leave of Absence Without Pay Leave of Absence Without Pay may be granted at the discretion of the Head of School within the contractual period for up to one year.

They are also customized for our school, based on our collective knowledge of the uniqueness of the Taipei American School community. Purpose: Clear and comprehensive teaching standards are a mainstay of world-class educational institutions (Stronge and Xu, 2017).  They allow teachers and administrators alike to identify and cultivate excellence in the classroom (Hattie and Clinton, 2010).  As a world-renowned educational institution striving always for excellence, Taipei American School obviously must maintain a clear and current set of teaching standards. However, it is not always automatically clear in what ways standards function within a school.  Perhaps the purpose is best clarified by John Hattie and Janet Clinton in their book, The Assessment of Teachers.  They explain that the majority of trained teachers are acceptably proficient in the classroom.  However, ‘acceptably proficient’ is hardly the gold standard of classroom practice.  Thus, for teachers demonstrating clear proficiency, standards are used to cultivate and direct professional growth across one’s career.  On the other hand, if a teacher fails to demonstrate proficiency, one hardly needs an elaboration of standards to see it, and the standards themselves are not the ideal mechanism for addressing difficulties at that more fundamental level. When we think about how documents like this one are best used, it is helpful to consider some parallels to the application of standards in the classroom.  When we develop a rubric for our students, for example, we do not do so in order to raise an unreachable bar and then ‘catch’ our students who fail.  Rather, rubrics and standards are shared with students for the purpose of encouraging selfawareness, to define the goals and objectives in their coursework, and to set comprehensive goals toward which each student can strive.  Rubrics also contain an array of knowledge and skills to be demonstrated in any particular classroom assignment, facilitating transparency between student and teacher.  Arguably, it would be impossible for any student to consistently do well without a clear definition of what it means to do well. Similarly, standards for teachers are here to serve our teaching work.  Teaching is an incredibly complex task, and being a teacher carries with it so many facets of performance that it can be difficult to maintain a consistent awareness of them all.  Furthermore, none of us is perfect in all aspects of our teaching.  Thus, having a comprehensive set of standards and goals for success allows us to reflect upon the wide diversity of strengths we already possess as well as the areas in which we might focus our efforts to improve.  Standards encourage us not to simply rest on our extant strengths but instead to continue striving to balance out our skills as best we are able, that we might become excellent teachers in a broad and well-rounded sense, maximizing what comes naturally and improving those skills that","@ID":61},{"#text":"Taipei American School Faculty Manual First update : 2012-2013 Second update : 2013-2014 Third update : 2016-2017 Fourth update : 2017-2018 Fifth update : 2019-2020 Sixth update : 2020-2021","@ID":1},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 4 July 1, 2020 TAS Values and Essential Capacities Schoolwide Values Across the School’s divisions and throughout the TAS community, the following values are emphasized: Honesty I am truthful to myself and others Respect I value myself and others, appreciate our differences, and treat others as I would want to be treated Kindness I am considerate, compassionate, and caring Responsibility I am trustworthy, reliable, and accountable to myself and my environment Courage I do what is right even if it is hard Essential Capacities In addition to a rigorous academic program Taipei American School students are expected to demonstrate eight Essential Capacities: • Analytical and Creative Thinking and Problem-solving o Identify, manage, and address complex problems o Detect bias and distinguish between reliable and unsound information o Control information overload o Formulate meaningful questions o Analyze and create ideas and knowledge o Use trial and error; devise and test solutions to problems o Imagine alternatives o Develop cross-disciplinary knowledge and perspectives o Engage in sustained reasoning o Synthesize and adapt","@ID":11},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 36 July 1, 2020 scheduled school holiday and will not be allowed to shorten the end of the school year nor to create a later starting date at the beginning of the school year.

Employees are expected to familiarize themselves with the contents of this handbook, as well as the approved policies of TAS.  The guidelines in this handbook do not deal with every possible circumstance and are to be implemented in light of common sense and sound judgment. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask the Human Resources Department. All employees should be aware that violation of school policies and procedures may subject the employee to corrective action, up to and including termination of employment. However, nothing in this handbook is intended to bind TAS or to create any contractual entitlement. In all cases, the employment contract is the exclusive binding document governing all employee-school relationships, questions, or disputes. While TAS strives to keep all faculty and staff fully apprised regarding policy and procedure changes, the School reserves the right to modify the policies and practices outlined in this handbook at any time, based on the needs of the School and at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors. Accordingly, there may be occasions in which School policy changes prior to the distribution of written notice to employees.","@ID":9},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 37 July 1, 2020 3.5 Benefits Employees shall receive benefits as described in the Employment Terms and Conditions for Professional Staff, which may be modified from time to time. 3.6 Channels of Communication Maximum effectiveness in the School is promoted through an open exchange of information and opinion: maximum efficiency is promoted through the utilization of well-established channels of communication. In order to promote the orderly functioning of the School, the Board and Administration should attempt to keep open all channels of communication and assure that community members start with the person most immediately involved, then follow the structure established by the organization chart if not satisfied. Official correspondence and formal communication between Employees of the Taipei American School and the Board of Directors must be through the office of the Head of School. 3.7 Conditional Letter of Intent A conditional letter of intent may be written by the Head of School.  When a conditional letter of intent is issued, the contents must state explicitly the conditions under which the contract will be renewed.  Contract renewal should be based on the needs of the School. 3.8 Deductions Advance notice to start, change or terminate a payroll deduction must be given to the Accounting Office. The Employee shall obtain and complete an Authorization from the director of Human Resources, one copy of which shall become a part of the Employee's permanent file. 3.9 Dislocation Allowance Qualified Employees shall receive dislocation allowance as described in the Employment Terms and Conditions for Professional Staff, which may be modified from time to time.","@ID":44},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 61 July 1, 2020 In the Lower School, after successfully completing the first year, teachers are observed and evaluated by the principal and associate principals every third year.  Typically, the teacher supervisor will conduct formal classroom observations—with greater frequency of course if problems or concerns arise during the first observation. The time and date of one of these observations should be mutually decided upon.  Prior to the planned observation, the teacher completes a Visit Planner Document and submits to their evaluator.  After each observation, the supervisor then completes a standardized lesson observation form and sends it to the teacher.  The teacher then completes the ‘teacher response’ portion of the form and sends it back to supervisor.  After observations are completed in this way, the teacher submits a final self-reflection.   Lastly, the teacher and supervisor will meet to discuss and reflect on observations and overall performance, which will also take into account parent interactions, collegial collaboration, participation in school projects and initiatives, and interactions with students outside of the classroom (e.g. in student clubs, teams, and other activities during and after the school day).  For teachers of grade three through five, student surveys are also considered.  The principal and/or associate principal will write a final summary for the teacher to sign, which is then kept on file with human resources. In the Middle School, the process of evaluation is carried out by both the principal and associate principal.  Typically, the department chair will observe and mentor teachers through new initiatives in curriculum and pedagogy, but they are not central in the evaluation process.  Instead, the principal or associate principal will conduct observations—again with greater frequency if any problems or concerns arise following the first observation.  After each observation, the teacher meets with the observer to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the observed lesson, new strategies and techniques for improvement, and finally goals for short term and long-term professional growth.  As with all observations, the discussion is then summarized in a final document authored by the observer, coupled with student survey data and observations of teacher engagement with colleagues and the larger community where appropriate or relevant.  This evaluation is then signed by the teacher and kept on file with human resources for reference.  Teachers who have succeeded in their first year are subsequently formally evaluated on a three-year cycle. In the Upper School, department heads assume primary responsibility of observation and assessment.  As each department operates with range and flexibility best fitted to the leadership style and preferences of each department chair, assessments vary by department.  Each department head observes each teacher within their department, providing feedback and documentation of observations to the teacher and to the admi istration.  The mode of that assessment may vary.  For example, in the Upper School English department, the department chair typically observes every teacher, meets with that teacher to discuss the class observed, and then writes a narrative report detailing the teaching practices and goals for future growth and development.  In contrast, in the sciences, the chair may require that a teacher submit a video of one full class period.  The chair and teacher then meet and review the video together, discussing strengths and room for improvement.  Finally, the chair produces a narrative summary of that meeting, while also incorporating commentary regarding the teacher’s performance writ large, again in terms of their work with other teachers, interactions with parents, student survey data, and the teacher’s enthusiastic engagement with the student community outside the classroom.  These reviews are conducted annually for every teacher in every department, and the final documentation is signed by both chair and teacher and kept on file with Human Resources.","@ID":68},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 39 July 1, 2020 3.15 Involuntary Termination All supervisors at Taipei American School are expected to instruct, counsel, advise and direct their subordinates.  Should an Employee exhibit unsatisfactory work performance and/or conduct, the supervisor must make every effort to be fair, just, and to consider all relevant facts, including said Employee's explanation of the situation.

In instances where the approval of the Employee's supervisor is required , the approval must come from the Administrator who has the responsibility to supervise the Employee. The Employee may use this leave in advance of accrual to the limit of that which will be earned during the contractual period. Use of Accrued Leave Illness. The Employee may use Accrued Leave for personal illness, quarantine at home, complications during pregnancy, or serious illness in the immediate family or household. Verification of illness by a medical doctor may be requested by the Head of School. Illness Leave Bank. The illness leave bank is established to assist Employees who have a shortterm illness that exhausts all their accumulated illness leave prior to becoming eligible for longterm disability. Once the Employee becomes eligible for long-term disability, he or she will no longer be eligible to request days from the illness leave bank. In the event that an Employee has exhausted his or her Accrued Leave, he or she may submit a request to the Human Resources Director to withdraw days from the illness leave bank, provided he or she has joined the bank prior to the illness. Such a request must be accompanied by verification by a medical doctor and must be approved by the Head of School. Days drawn from the illness leave bank may only be used for personal illness, quarantine, complications during pregnancy, or serious illness in the immediate family or household.","@ID":30},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 56 July 1, 2020 1.6  Uses student learning data to inform instructional planning. 1.7  Plans effectively for pacing, sequencing, content mastery, and assessment. 1.8   Demonstrates a mastery of subject matter and an understanding of pedagogical practices that reflect current research on best practices. 1.9  When teaching online, prepares a navigable, intuitive course website with a range of age appropriate materials and learning activities.

This policy applies to all Employees of TAS, regardless of their position. Prohibited sexual harassment includes sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an Employee’s or student’s performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating or sexually offensive working environment.  In addition, no manager, supervisor, teacher or other staff member, male or female, may sexually harass any Employee or student by making submission to or rejection of sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment or education or a basis for employment or educational decisions.  An Employee who engages in sexual harassment shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. TAS also recognizes that harassment on the basis of race, religion, age, sex, color, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability or other legally-protected status is inappropriate in the workplace.  Conduct prohibited includes, but is not limited to, racial or ethnic slurs and epithets.  An Employee who believes that he or she has been subject to any such harassment is encouraged to report the matter promptly, using the complaint procedure outlined below.  Any Employee who violates this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. It is also a violation of TAS policy to retaliate against an Employee for making or filing a complaint of harassment or for cooperating in an investigation of a complaint of harassment.  Any such retaliation will also result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. If an Employee believes that she or he has been subjected to sexual or other harassment prohibited by this policy, whether by a supervisor, a co-worker or any other person with whom the Employee comes into contact in connection with his/her work for TAS, the Employee should report the incident immediately to the Human Resources Department.  An Employee may choose instead to contact the head of his or her school unit or another TAS manager or supervisor with whom the Employee feels comfortable. Any claim may be made orally or in writing. The following is an outline of the procedure that is generally pursued once a complaint has been brought to the attention of TAS: • A prompt and impartial investigation of the complaint is conducted by the Human Resources Director or another specifically designated manager or supervisor.  That investigation may include (but will not necessarily be limited to) interviews with the Employee who made the complaint, with the person or persons against whom the complaint was made, and with other employees who may have witnessed the reported incident or incidents.","@ID":17},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 13 July 1, 2020 1.10 Qualification and Placement Applicants for Professional Staff Positions should have at least: a.

No Employee of the School or members of any Employee’s immediate family will accept gifts from any person, group, or entity doing or designed to do business with the School, and all business– related gratuities are specifically prohibited except items of nominal value that are widely distributed for the purpose of advertising. 1.4 Harassment The Taipei American School expects that adults in its employ will recognize that students’ safety, welfare, and health are our highest priority. It is the responsibility of adults charged with any aspect of the care and teaching of students to ensure that interactions among all members of the community are appropriate.  Adults associated with the School must ensure that they model attitudes and behaviors that reflect their awareness of this obligation, and create an environment in which the best interests of students are the highest priority. TAS condemns and expressly forbids any sexual contact or inappropriate relationships between adults and students and harassment of any kind.   At the beginning of each new school year at the opening address to Faculty, the Head of School will remind all teaching faculty that it is NEVER acceptable to put hands on a student in anger or with romantic intentions.  This does not mean that we may never provide an appropriate pat on the back or accept an offered hug from a student.  It does mean that touching a student in a way that results in the adult fulfilling his or her needs rather than to encourage a student is forbidden.  Disciplinary action up to and including termination will result.  It is expected that all Principals will make these expectations clear to all staff working with students as soon in the new year as possible, with clarity and firmness. TAS also forbids any personally offensive or threatening conduct or behavior directed against an individual or group for any reason, including but not limited to on the basis of a person’s ethnic origin, religion, gender or a person’s sexual orientation. All Employees of TAS are expected to demonstrate appropriate social media use and communication with students as stated in the Acceptable Use Policy for technology resources. All Employees are expected promptly to report to the Administration any acts of hazing, harassment or bullying of students, or any inappropriate relationships between other Employees and students.","@ID":16},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 60 July 1, 2020 Though each case is unique, performance problems of that degree of severity usually come to the attention of administrators quickly through a variety of channels, some of which are outlined above at the beginning of this section.  Administrators may observe problematic teaching personally when they visit classrooms and watch lessons as they do with all new hires.  Alternatively, parents and students may have negative experiences and report them to administrators.  Perhaps there may be reported or observed difficulties around conduct with colleagues or students.  Any or all of the above moments should naturally spur administrators to offer extra attention and support to aid that teacher in succeeding in the classroom if they are able. Regular evaluations, a standard practice in all schools, represent one mechanism that does ensur the appropriate level of professionalism and professional growth for all teachers, and by implication, the best possible education for all students.  Our school’s definition of professionalism is to continually strive toward meeting these teaching standards, to have strong and current content knowledge, to take initiative, to take risks, and to take responsibility for continuously improving instructional practices to add value for our students, colleagues, and our school as a whole.  It is well understood that no teacher is master of all aspects of teaching; the goal is to always be striving for professional growth and mastery.  Thus, to reiterate, these standards should not serve as a checklist for ‘grading’ teachers.  They do, however, provide a framework for conferencing and goal setting. Exactly how these evaluations are conducted must necessarily vary by division as well as length of a teacher’s time at Taipei American School. For teachers new to TAS there are necessarily specific considerations shaping the evaluation timeline and process.  New teachers face tremendous personal and professional adjustment as they get used to the ways of our school and of Taiwan.  The initial evaluation process is intended to support that adjustment by clearly outlining measures of success and methods for achieving that success.  Thus, the first observation, typically conducted by both a department chair and a principal or vice principal, takes place within the first few weeks of arrival at Taipei American School.  All newly hired teachers begin on a probationary status for the first ninety days, and these observations ensure that the teacher is indeed an appropriate fit for our school.  In addition, teachers are evaluated in terms of their engagement with parents, cooperation and collaboration with colleagues, participation in schoolwide initiatives and projects, and of course the quality and frequency of their interactions with students outside classroom environs.  For teachers of grades three through twelve, students complete anonymous surveys in early spring each year, and their perspective on teacher performance are also taken into account.  Taken together, all of these elements provide clear direction for the teacher during their adjustment period, so that they might quickly and appropriately adapt and provide the highest quality experience for our students.  If significant teaching performance concerns are observed, the first step is to offer specific mentoring and developmental support to enable that teacher to meet those objectives.  Very rarely, such concerns rise to the level that successful meeting of our standards is deemed unlikely or impossible, and in such cases contracts are typically not renewed. For teachers not new to TAS, teacher evaluations continue at a different pace, and for all teachers the assessment of teaching standards will vary by division.","@ID":67},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 11 July 1, 2020 • Upon completion of the investigation, the manager who conducted that investigation will meet individually with the Employee who made the complaint and the Employee or Employees against whom the complaint was made, to report the results of the investigation and, where an action is determined to be appropriate, to inform the parties of the steps that will be taken to correct the situation. TAS strives to release information arising out of a complaint or investigation of harassment only on a need to know basis.  Employees should be aware, however, that information must be shared in order for an effective investigation to be conducted and, also, that any manager or supervisor who receives a complaint of harassment from an Employee or who otherwise knows or has reason to believe that an Employee is or has been subjected to harassment is expected to report the incident promptly to the Human Resources Director for investigation. 1.5 Nationalities 1.

In this way, standards allow teachers to take responsibility for their professional growth.  That is the central function of these standards. Of course, in addition to our own reflections, teachers are also evaluated professionally by administrators to determine whether teaching is meeting the very high standards at Taipei American School.  Outlining specific teaching behaviors and goals is key to fair, comprehensive, and instructive evaluations for teachers. However, standards do not themselves present a mechanism for communicating in an evaluative manner between supervisors and teachers.  To continue with the student rubric analogy above:  used appropriately rubrics guide students striving to develop mastery.  Similarly, standards should be used to shape growth, not to rank and score teachers against one another.  We also would not use a rubric to inform a student that they have misunderstood the entire assignment.  We would not use a rubric to inform a student that they will not successfully pass a course.  Therefor rubrics have a valuable but limited function.  When we notice students having difficulties succeeding in class, teachers address those problems most effectively through conversations, coaching, and conferences. Obviously, teachers are not students and rubrics are not standards per se, but the parallel is helpful for illustrating the principle.  Teachers who are not meeting standards to such a degree that they may not be adequately fulfilling their role should expect that their administrators and department chairs (depending on division) would clearly state that fact and explain in what way this is so.  Teachers can expect that administrators would want to meet with them regularly, set specific goals and time frames for attaining those goals, and ultimately to evaluate the outcomes of those efforts together in dialogue.  These standards do present a kind of architecture for such discussions, but they are not intended to provide a mechanism for assessment nor a means for addressing problems severe enough to call into question whether the teacher is qualified, prepared, or suitable for continuing at Taipei American School beyond the terms of his or her current contract.","@ID":66},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 44 July 1, 2020 3.26 Working Days and Hours Professional Staff work-days will be established by the Head of School and presented to the Board in the Academic School Calendar.

However, regardless of variations of mode in the evaluation process, all formal evaluations are undertaken with these same high standards of professional performance in mind.  In cases where teachers do not meet those standards even after mentorship and professional development options have been explored, contracts are typically not renewed.  At Taipei American School, we believe this ensures fairness and clarity in teacher feedback and retention, a consistent and individualized program for teacher professional development, and, most importantly, the highest quality educational experience for all of our students.","@ID":69},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 25 July 1, 2020 complications requiring confinement beyond the fifty-six (56) days of maternity leave.

To protect faculty and staff, whenever possible all electronic communication with students must go through the School’s email system or LMS (Learning Management System); exceptions may be made only when groups of students are appropriately involved (e.g., IASAS check-in, StuGov Facebook page, TAS athletic team pages), or in the case of an emergency. Given the School’s commitment to acting at all times with the students’ best interests in mind, faculty and staff are not permitted to “friend” or otherwise establish a relationship with any current students on Facebook or any other social media site. In order to establish such a relationship, faculty and staff must wait until students have graduated from TAS, or, in the case of students who leave TAS before graduation, until students have reached age 18. Electronic communication beyond School-provided email, including but not limited to social media websites, blogs, and texting, introduces the possibility of numerous problems for the faculty member and for the School.  The informal nature of this media tends to blur the critically appropriate boundaries of faculty-student relationships. Faculty should exercise considerable caution in the way they conduct and portray themselves through social networking venues, websites, and blogs.  Even casual participation in some online spaces can bring negative attention upon both the faculty member and the School, and the School has an obligation to respond to online conduct bearing upon a faculty member’s professional standing and personal conduct if either is deemed to be injurious to the best interests of the School or to any of our current or former students.  Specifically, the School asks all faculty and staff members to exercise great discretion and self-discipline with regard to social networking websites. Furthermore, the School urges faculty to exercise significant professional discretion when “friending” or otherwise establishing a relationship with graduates (or former TAS students 18 years of age and older) on social media sites, even though appropriate communications via the School’s network are encouraged to strengthen the School’s loyal alumni base. It is important to remember that information shared between or among recent alumni/ae is likely to be seen by current students as well. 7.4 Social Media Guidelines for School “Affiliated” Groups These guidelines apply to teachers, staff, and TAS community members working with our students and greater community in an affiliated but unofficial way. This includes student organizations and others. All communications should be created in the spirit of upholding a compassionate, safe, and healthful community with respect, responsibility, kindness, honesty, and courage.","@ID":74},{"#text":"mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 7 July 1, 2020 Chapter 1: Human Resources 1.1 Human Resources Department The Human Resources Department (HR), located on the second floor in the administrative area, provides various support services to all divisions and departments of TAS.  One of HR’s primary responsibilities is to assist the educational and administrative leaders of the School in the steps needed to attract, recruit, hire, develop and motivate employees to carry out the programs of the School, through • Recruitment support • Compensation administration • Benefits administration • Orientation of new faculty and support staff • Employee relations for Employees seeking guidance or clarification HR is responsible for interpreting school personnel policies and procedures in conjunction with School Administrators and under the direction of the Head of School.

As a service-oriented department, HR is available to support other departments in their administration of personnel policies and procedures, and in direct support of Employees. Each Employee of TAS has direct access to services from the Human Resources Department.  There are several members of HR to serve the needs of TAS Employees.  Each member has specific functions to better serve the needs of school Employees. 1.2 Human Resources Philosophy The Taipei American School Board and Administration should promote maximum educational benefit for the students through effective and efficient use of school resources. In a school composed of a transient community, a formal organization should be based upon established policies, regulations, relationships, and channels of communication that will best serve the needs of the School. Under direction of the Head of School, the organization should utilize management techniques that promote maximum efficiency and effectiveness. A line and staff structure should be developed that clearly assigns authority and responsibility within the organization. Administrative regulations and directives should be formulated to provide for continuity in administration of the organization, in compliance with board policy.

When we pursue professional development, it isn’t because we have been failing at our work.  Rather, we strive always to improve and to grow.  A comprehensive set of standards can help us in setting our professional goals, so that we might remain cognizant of all the areas in which we might continue to improve as professionals. Thus, our standards are articulated here to help clarify the definition of an excellent teacher, and in so doing, to encourage self-reflection and professional growth.  Furthermore, having a clear shared definition of good teaching can ultimately structure and guide discussions with observers and fellow teachers. At the end of the 2019-2020 school year, the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic.  In order to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and administration, we went through several stints of online learning.  Though fortunately Taiwan has done an exceptional job containing the virus, it became clear that our standards should be adjusted slightly to specify some of the expectations regarding online learning.  As with our standards for classroom teaching—the idea is to guide teacher adaptation and professional development as they may have to move again to distance learning one day.  Thus, for the 2020-21 edition of our teaching standards we have adapted a few additional specifics.  We used the VLLA National Standards for Quality Online Teaching as a well-researched model on which to base our adjustments.
