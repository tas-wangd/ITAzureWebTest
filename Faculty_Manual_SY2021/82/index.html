 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 75 July 1, 2020 Random testing will occur throughout the year. When the Administration deems that concerns exist, it may, without prior notice, require selective testing on individual students, whether or not a waiver has been signed. The waiver covers only the random screening. Normally, students who voluntarily contact the Principal (directly, or via a counselor) and seek aid or information concerning alcohol or drug abuse are not subject to disciplinary action; this is true only if the student is not coming forth merely to avoid detection or to explain a drug infraction. For example, coming for help just after receiving notification that a drug test will be performed will be construed as an attempt to avoid detection, not as a plea for help. Parents and students should be aware that the policy and rules relating to drug use infractions are deliberately stringent. They were developed both to preserve the welfare of the majority of students and to respect the laws of the R.O.C. 9.6 Use of Alcohol Students may not be under the influence of or possess alcohol on school property.  Students who come to school or school-sponsored activities after ingesting alcohol or in possession of alcohol will be asked to leave school or the activity immediately. Parents will be notified. In the event it is an off- campus activity or trip, the offense could result in the termination of the entire trip. Students who are allowed to continue attending TAS after being caught under the influence or in possession of alcohol will, at a minimum, be placed on social probation and may be barred from participation in any school-related activity.
