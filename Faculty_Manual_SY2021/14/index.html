As a service-oriented department, HR is available to support other departments in their administration of personnel policies and procedures, and in direct support of Employees. Each Employee of TAS has direct access to services from the Human Resources Department.  There are several members of HR to serve the needs of TAS Employees.  Each member has specific functions to better serve the needs of school Employees. 1.2 Human Resources Philosophy The Taipei American School Board and Administration should promote maximum educational benefit for the students through effective and efficient use of school resources. In a school composed of a transient community, a formal organization should be based upon established policies, regulations, relationships, and channels of communication that will best serve the needs of the School. Under direction of the Head of School, the organization should utilize management techniques that promote maximum efficiency and effectiveness. A line and staff structure should be developed that clearly assigns authority and responsibility within the organization. Administrative regulations and directives should be formulated to provide for continuity in administration of the organization, in compliance with board policy. The School will set high standards for recruiting and retaining faculty, Administrators, and support staff, for developing them and for evaluating their performance.
