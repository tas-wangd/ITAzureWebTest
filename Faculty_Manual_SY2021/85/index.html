 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 78 July 1, 2020 Once any complaint of bullying, cyber-bullying or retaliation is received, a prompt investigation of the charge will be conducted by the appropriate school Principal or other designated administrator. The investigation will take into account all of the relevant circumstances, including the nature of the allegations and the ages of the students involved. If the investigation results in a determination that bullying, cyber-bullying or retaliation has occurred, the School will take appropriate disciplinary action, which may include the full range of disciplinary sanctions for other forms of student misconduct, up to and including dismissal from the School.  The School will notify the parent/guardians of the target and of the perpetrator of this finding and of the School’s planned response.  The School may also report to the administrator of another school, if the incident of bullying, cyber-bullying or retaliation involves students from another school. During an investigation, the School cannot assure strict confidentiality, because information must be shared in order to conduct an effective investigation.  However, the School will only release information concerning complaints of bullying, cyber-bullying, and/or retaliation on a legitimate, need-to-know basis, in each case as determined by the School. 10.2 Closed Campus In the interest of maintaining student safety and reducing student truancy, TAS students must remain on the school campus throughout the school day. The Head of School or his/her designee may exclude students of senior status from this regulation if it is deemed appropriate, and may make other exceptions for individual students where extenuating circumstances dictate. 10.3 Corporal Punishment Corporal punishment is unacceptable at Taipei American School. 10.4 Hazing Hazing is prohibited at Taipei American School, as is retaliation for reporting or providing information about hazing.  Hazing means any conduct or method of initiation into any student group that endangers the physical or mental well-being of a student or other person. 10.5 Make-Up Work (Secondary Students) Make–up work following any absence is the responsibility of the student and must be done promptly. For an approved absence, time for make–up shall normally be equal to twice the number of days of
