 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 76 July 1, 2020 Chapter 10: Student Academic Life 10.1 Anti-Bullying Each student at the Taipei American School has the right to participate fully in the life of the School without experiencing bullying or cyber-bullying. The School recognizes and respects individual differences, and does not discriminate, tolerate discrimination or permit unwarranted interference in the education of students. To ensure an environment of mutual respect, tolerance, and sensitivity, every member of the community, including students, faculty, and staff, must recognize and adhere to certain guidelines for appropriate behavior. Inappropriate behavior towards others, whether verbal or physical, is unacceptable. Such behavior includes unwelcome physical advances; discriminatory comments between any two individuals or groups of individuals; or words, acts, or gestures that cause physical or emotional harm, cause a reasonable fear of harm, create a hostile environment, or otherwise infringe on the rights of another. Bullying is the repeated use by one or more students of a written, verbal, or electronic expression or a physical act or gesture, or any combination thereof, directed at another student that: • causes physical or emotional harm to the target or damage to the targeted student’s property; • places the targeted student in reasonable fear of harm to himself or of damage to his property; • creates a hostile environment at school for the targeted student; • infringes on the rights of the targeted student at school; or • materially and substa tially disrupts the education process or the orderly operation of the school. Bullying may include conduct such as physical intimidation or assault, including intimidating an individual into tak ng an action against his/her will; oral or written threats; teasing; put-downs; name-calling; stalking; threatening looks, gestures, or actions; unkind rumors; false accusations; and social isolation.
