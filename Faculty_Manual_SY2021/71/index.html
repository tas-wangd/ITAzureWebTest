Funds need to be requested from and approved by the divisional Principals. Each division is allotted a finite pool of funds to support the achievement of annual divisional goals and initiatives. To request divisional funds, please complete and submit the Divisional PD Funding Request Form to the appropriate Principal. 6.3 Eligibility All full-time faculty members are eligible for professional development funding throughout the calendar year. Incoming faculty members will become eligible for professional development funding at the beginning of their contract term (July 1), unless requested to attend an activity before the initiation of their contract. 6.4 Departing Faculty Departing faculty members will be ineligible for any professional development funding in the final year of their service. 6.5 Practices &amp; Procedures In general, all planning arrangements and reimbursements for School-funded travel need to be processed with the assistance of the secretary of the appropriate department or office and in conjunction with the PD Secretary. Faculty must have divisional approval to take part in a School funded professional development activity, for which he/she will need to fill out a registration form (sponsoring organization), PD Travel Request form (PD Secretary) and a Leave Request (divisional offices). All forms need to be returned to the PD Secretary and the approved leave request needs to be forwarded to HR Office for processing. It is important to keep all receipts and boarding passes and turn them in to the PD Secretary upon your return. Only receipts that are itemized can be reimbursed. Credit card receipts are not accepted as official receipts. All receipts (Fa Piaos) issued in Taiwan must have the School’s tax ID number ( 29905011 ) included on it.
