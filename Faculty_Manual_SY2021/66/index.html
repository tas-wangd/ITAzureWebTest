 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 59 July 1, 2020 6.3  Exercises appropriate diligence to protect the safety and welfare of all students during hotel, homestay and residential arrangements on school or team excursions, trips, and student exchanges. 6.4  Demonstrates knowledge and competency in all relevant procedures and coordinated emergency drills that ensure student and schoolwide safety. 5.2 How Standards are Applied at Taipei American School These standards define specific teaching behaviors that, based on research and current practice, influence student achievement and school climate.  By clearly stating our expectations in the form of teaching standards, faculty members are provided a great breadth of indicators to prompt reflection on teaching performance and to focus and improve classroom instruction and overall efficacy.  In this way, standards allow teachers to take responsibility for their professional growth.  That is the central function of these standards. Of course, in addition to our own reflections, teachers are also evaluated professionally by administrators to determine whether teaching is meeting the very high standards at Taipei American School.  Outlining specific teaching behaviors and goals is key to fair, comprehensive, and instructive evaluations for teachers. However, standards do not themselves present a mechanism for communicating in an evaluative manner between supervisors and teachers.  To continue with the student rubric analogy above:  used appropriately rubrics guide students striving to develop mastery.  Similarly, standards should be used to shape growth, not to rank and score teachers against one another.  We also would not use a rubric to inform a student that they have misunderstood the entire assignment.  We would not use a rubric to inform a student that they will not successfully pass a course.  Therefor rubrics have a valuable but limited function.  When we notice students having difficulties succeeding in class, teachers address those problems most effectively through conversations, coaching, and conferences. Obviously, teachers are not students and rubrics are not standards per se, but the parallel is helpful for illustrating the principle.  Teachers who are not meeting standards to such a degree that they may not be adequately fulfilling their role should expect that their administrators and department chairs (depending on division) would clearly state that fact and explain in what way this is so.  Teachers can expect that administrators would want to meet with them regularly, set specific goals and time frames for attaining those goals, and ultimately to evaluate the outcomes of those efforts together in dialogue.  These standards do present a kind of architecture for such discussions, but they are not intended to provide a mechanism for assessment nor a means for addressing problems severe enough to call into question whether the teacher is qualified, prepared, or suitable for continuing at Taipei American School beyond the terms of his or her current contract.
