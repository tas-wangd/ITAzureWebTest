 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 71 July 1, 2020 Chapter 8: Information Security Policy 8.1 Information Security Policy All employees must realize that outsiders may be listening or watching and may be able to pick up Information they should not have. You should not, for example, discuss sensitive School matters in places where conversations can be overheard by others, such as in corridors, restrooms, elevators, restaurants and the reception and other common areas (including restrooms) of the School, or while commuting or traveling by public means. You should bear in mind that telephone conversations may be intercepted, as may e-mail transmissions. You should be careful how you handle and dispose of sensitive papers: they should be shredded in a secure manner. Laptop computers should be secured and should be shielded from the view of others while you are working on School matters in a public place or traveling on an airplane or public transportation. Anyone receiving communications or inquiries from an unfamiliar person whose authenticity may be in question should decline to provide any confidential or sensitive information until the authenticity of the source can be established. Our policy is that all student and donor information is confidential (as is the other information identified in our “Confidentiality” policy, and must be handled as such by all School personnel. There is some student information that should never be discussed even within the School with anyone who is not part of the team of individuals who have a need to know the information in furtherance of their service to that student. Moreover, you should not ask about or otherwise seek to obtain confidential information about any matter unrelated to work that you are performing for the School. Take care to minimize the risk of misuse or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by: • securing in your office or classroom documents that contain sensitive information and not leaving them where they can be observed by visitors; • maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive documents by keeping them in appropriately marked file folders or envelopes and circulating them within the School only in envelopes marked “confidential;&quot; • discarding sensitive documents by shredding them; • keeping laptops, PDAs, and other mobile computer devices within view or securely stored at all times; shutting down or screensaver-locking such devices, or logging out of accounts, when not in use;
