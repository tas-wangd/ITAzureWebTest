 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 49 July 1, 2020 Times and locations of divisional faculty meetings: Lower School  – 2:45 in the Lower School Library Middle School – 3:45 in the Middle School Library Upper School   – 3:45 in the Upper School Library, Lecture Hall, or MPR 4.6 Home Learning Home learning will be considered a necessary part of the learning process and a legitimate d mand on the non-class time of students. Generally, home learning should provide sufficient practice time to master the Essential Capacities, standards, benchmarks, and subject matter of the course. A home assignment should be an extension of clearly defined school activities and should be appropriate to the age and ability level of students. Teachers should assign meaningful home learning which fosters lesson enrichment, exploration, application, review and the study, and the practice of skills. Home learning should also provide an opportunity for open-ended individual activities encompassing a variety of levels for suitable response and a variety of activities and products. The home learning policies per division are: Lower School Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday Kindergarten to Grade 3: Reading at home and 10 minutes Mandarin per night Grades 4 and 5:  Reading, math and 10-15 minutes Mandarin per night Middle School The time spent on home learning increases as the student progresses through middle school.  The minutes below represent recommended times to be spent on home learning.  It is not feasible to establish rigid time limits.   The average time for home learning is: Grade 6:  90 minutes average/day Grade 7:  120 minutes average/day Grade 8:  150 minutes average/day In addition, in some leveled courses, particularly math, the home learning guidelines are the same as upper school (see chart below). This would be additional time spent on home learning per day. Upper School Grades 9-12:  The course catalog identifies the amount of home learning required for each course (heavy, moderate, light).  Each course description includes a statement about the amount of time
