 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 55 July 1, 2020 require more focus and effort.  When we pursue professional development, it isn’t because we have been failing at our work.  Rather, we strive always to improve and to grow.  A comprehensive set of standards can help us in setting our professional goals, so that we might remain cognizant of all the areas in which we might continue to improve as professionals. Thus, our standards are articulated here to help clarify the definition of an excellent teacher, and in so doing, to encourage self-reflection and professional growth.  Furthermore, having a clear shared definition of good teaching can ultimately structure and guide discussions with observers and fellow teachers. At the end of the 2019-2020 school year, the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic.  In order to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and administration, we went through several stints of online learning.  Though fortunately Taiwan has done an exceptional job containing the virus, it became clear that our standards should be adjusted slightly to specify some of the expectations regarding online learning.  As with our standards for classroom teaching—the idea is to guide teacher adaptation and professional development as they may have to move again to distance learning one day.  Thus, for the 2020-21 edition of our teaching standards we have adapted a few additional specifics.  We used the VLLA National Standards for Quality Online Teaching as a well-researched model on which to base our adjustments.  We believe the standards now reflect a powerful set of guidelines for both classroom and distance teaching.  It is expected that, as circumstances and technologies evolve, there may be additional edits in the future, in response to the experiences and recommendations of our faculty and their supervisors. The standards are here presented in categories for easier reading and comprehension, but they are not listed in order of priority or significance. Performance Standard 1: Instructional Preparation and Knowledge The teacher plans using the TAS curriculum content, effective strategies, and resources while demonstrating a deep understanding of the curriculum, subject content, and the developmental needs of students. Indicators 1.1 Us s TAS curriculum content as a framework for unit or lesson planning and maintains a current record in the school’s curriculum mapping software. 1.2  Effectively addresses the 21st Century Essential Capacities and TAS values in unit and lesson plans. 1.3  Effectively plans and organizes to address the developmental needs of all students. 1.4  Plans instruction consistent with language learning needs of students. 1.5  Engages in regular and meaningful collaborative planning.
