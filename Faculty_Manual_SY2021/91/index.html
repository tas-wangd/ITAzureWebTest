The Head of School or his/her designee shall develop and implement procedures for security including patrols, access control, identification, traffic control, dealing with trespassers, etc.  Guards shall be employed and regularly trained to protect students and staff, prevent damage to the TAS buildings and grounds, and adequately affect surveillance of all the property of Taipei American School during and after regular school hours. The Head of School or his/her designee is responsible for developing procedures for reporting security problems.  All staff members are responsible for reporting incidents that threaten the security of students or staff or damages to or loss of any school property. Personal effects should be kept locked.  Since TAS is virtually ‘unlocked’ during the day, the opportunity for theft is apparent.  Staff and students should leave valuables at home.  Please be aware of strangers in your classroom area and ask if you can be of assistance. 11.14 Lost, Stolen or Damaged School Equipment/Property The Head of School or his/her designee is responsible for developing procedures to ensure that school equipment is in good working order and available as needed.  It is the responsibility of all staff members who are assigned or who requisition school equipment to adequately safeguard such equipment.  Losses due to lost, stolen or damaged school property/equipment, excepting wear due to normal use, may be charged to the individual responsible for that property/equipment.
