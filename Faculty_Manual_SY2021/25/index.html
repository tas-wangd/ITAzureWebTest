 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 18 July 1, 2020 Employee. An Employee receiving long-term disability insurance payments will not receive salary from TAS; however, if the Employee is eligible for livelihood supplement, and the Employee and/or Authorized Dependents remain in Taiwan, the livelihood supplement will continue until either the end of the school year in which the disability payments begin or the time the Employee and his or her Authorized Dependents leave Taiwan, whichever comes first. 2.2.7  Retirement Plan Participation in the School&#39;s retirement plan is mandatory.  The School will contribute 10% of the Employee&#39;s annual base salary to the Employee&#39;s retirement account.  This percentage is indicated on Appendix A.  The contribution will be made in equal monthly installments. 2.2.8  Tuition and Busing Tuition remission is an annual contractual benefit.  Tuition and school bus transportation may be provided for each Authorized Dependent listed on a current faculty contract and attending the School.  Taipei Youth Program Association membership fees will be waived for these Authorized Dependents. On rare occasions, and at the sole discretion of the Head of School, special monetary educational assistance (not to exceed TAS’s published tuition fee amount) may be provided to a faculty member whose Authorized Dependent may not attend the School due to identified learning needs in line with the following criteria: • the eligible employee has completed at least 20 consecutive years of successful service at TAS • the Authorized Dependent is not admissible to the School because of documented special education needs, and accompanying conditions that cause the school to be concerned for the Authorized Dependent’s safety based on documented medical condition(s). At the sole discretion of the Head of School, special monetary educational assistance (not to exceed TAS’s published tuition fee amount) may be provided to an Administrator whose Authorized Dependent may not attend the School due to identified special learning needs or other unique special circumstances as deemed appropriate by the Head of School. Presentation of receipts for the monetary educational assistance may be requested by the Head of School.
