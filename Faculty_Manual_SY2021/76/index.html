 mployee in Confidence - TAS Employees Only Page | 69 July 1, 2020 There are few restrictions on sharing content with students (whether digitally or in print). We expect teachers to follow Fair Use guidelines on any US copyrighted material. The good news is that if you could show it in a class, or hand it out as a photocopy, you can publish it digitally provided that access is limited to students who are currently enrolled in the class. However, just as you could not photocopy and distribute an entire book, neither should you share an entire text where the digital copy carries only individual rights. Similarly, you can play a song or view a movie that contributes to the content of the course-provided that the sharing is restricted to students enrolled in the course. You cannot show the film purely for entertainment value Employee Internal Use / Professional Development The rules here can be somewhat more restrictive than for student-teacher use, but the same basic provisions apply. Community Use Once we reach community access, we fall outside of most of the legal exceptions. Please see External Publications External Publication Any document, video, audio or other file shared outside the class or professional development setting should be assumed to be public. With that in mind, particularly as it concerns video or audio files, we require that particular care be taken. Procedures Teacher Student Use When in doubt, always distribute inside a system that restricts access. For example, documents, etc. distributed through Canvas are limited to students enrolled in the class. Employee Internal Use / Professional Development Please exercise due diligence to be certain that all necessary rights have been obtained and that all relevant acknowledgements are included. The use of Creative Commons or other unrestricted sources for images, etc. is preferred. Internally distributed professional development material shall be within the Fair Use guidelines.
